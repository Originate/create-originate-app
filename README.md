`npx github:Originate/create-originate-app [app name]` to get started

## design document

See [issue 1](https://github.com/Originate/create-originate-app/issues/1).

## development install

You won't want to constantly run `npx` as you work on COA. You can instead clone this project to a `vendor` directory inside a test project and then modify COA from within that directory.

- `yarn init [app name]`
- `cd [app name]`
- `git clone https://github.com/Originate/create-originate-app vendor/`
- `rm -f package.json && ./vendor/bootstrap`

`rm -f package.json && ./vendor/boostrap` is designed to be run as many times as you want (idempotent), so you should be able to add new features to COA and then see them immediately by rerunning that one-liner.

## features thus far

### `yarn console`

Runs TypeScript on the much-beloved Watch Modeâ„¢ so you can keep an eye on type mishaps across the whole project while you write new code or refactor. You can run `yarn typecheck` to just typecheck once.

### `yarn dev`

This spins up the HTTP service on endpoint `http://localhost:3000` and webpack-dev-server on endpoint `http://localhost:8080`. (We've taught Webpack to proxy server requests back to `:3000`.) If you open `:8080` in a browser, you should see the changes you make to your React components appear on the page in realtime. You may know this feature variously as Hot Module Reloading or Fast Refresh. No matter what you call it, it's cool.
